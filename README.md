# Why Use box-sizing: border-box?

- Simplifies Layout: The total width/height stays consistent, making layouts easier to design.
- Avoids Overflow Issues: Ensures elements fit within their container, even when padding or borders are added.
- Widely Used: Many modern CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) set box-sizing: border-box; globally.
